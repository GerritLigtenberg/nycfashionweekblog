    <h2>Getting Tickets &amp; Picking the Shows</h2>

    <p>If you’re lucky or connected you can get an invite, sans the price tag. But I wasn’t so lucky or connected my first 2 years so I’m here to help you out. First, plan out which shows are most important to you and make a schedule and this is a biggie: <strong>SET A BUDGET</strong>. If you’re worrying about blowing your cash the whole time you won’t have fun. Then check out prices, days, and times and prioritize the designers you want to see most. Lastly, purchase your tickets and get excited!</p>

    <h2>Dressing for the Shows</h2>

    <p>Always be true to your own sense of style, if you don’t you’ll be uncomfortable the whole time and it will show. Remember, NYFW is about expressing yourself and taking in what the designers have chosen to express through their new lines. Also it’s important to wear shoes you’ll be comfortable in all day. Obviously you want to look good, but you’ll be on your feet all day long, so be prepared.</p>

    <h2>Backstage Access: What Really Happens Behind the Curtains</h2>

    <p>Getting backstage isn’t just about having a pass—it’s about being in the right place, at the right time, with the right energy. My first time backstage, I was totally overwhelmed (read: glam chaos, steamers everywhere, and models changing in the blink of an eye). But it was also electric. If you get the chance to go behind the scenes, say yes—even if you’re just volunteering or tagging along with someone. Bring comfortable shoes, stay out of the way, and soak up everything. You’ll see how much work, talent, and last-minute magic goes into every look that hits the runway.</p>

    <h2>Where to Spot Celebs &amp; Influencers During NYFW</h2>

    <p>If you’re hoping to spot your favorite A-lister or influencer during NYFW, don’t just hang around the tents—think cafés, pop-ups, and lobbies. The first time I saw a celeb, it was completely random (hint: it was the lobby of The Bowery Hotel and yes, she was that fabulous). Plan your coffee stops and arrive early to shows—lots of creators and stylists hang out nearby before going in. Fashion parties and smaller designer showcases also tend to draw interesting crowds. Keep your camera ready, but be cool—fashion people love confidence, not chaos.</p>

    <h2>Networking at NYFW: Making the Most of Every Event</h2>

    <p>I used to think networking at NYFW meant handing out business cards at parties. Nope. It’s way more natural than that—and way more effective if you approach it with intention. Start by knowing what you bring to the table: are you a writer, stylist, creator, designer? Then be open, curious, and generous with your time. Compliment someone’s outfit (sincerely), ask who they’re excited to see, or just introduce yourself. Some of my favorite collabs came from casual chats while waiting in line or sharing a cab. Don’t force it—fashion people can spot fake vibes a mile away.</p>
